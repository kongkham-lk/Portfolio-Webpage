            Architecture is one of the fields in which I am particularly interested, as I have spent a lot of time studying and working on it.
        </p>
        <p id="p">
            In Thailand, I studied architecture for five years before working in the field for another three years. It was a lot of fun and excitement
            at the time because everything was trial and error. I had a chance to explore new things, face new challenges, adapt to new skills, gain
            new knowledge, and learn how to deal with work stress.
        </p>
        <p id="p">
            The best part of working in the field is that I had the chance to explore new architecture and gain new techniques. When visiting places
            with good design, I not only get to learn about the concept of the building but also about space planning, room arrangement, construction
            detail, and more.

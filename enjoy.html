            There are a few small things that I try to accomplish in order to help me enjoy my life more.
        </p>
        <p id="p">
            Starting the day by jogging in the early morning and having a cup of good coffee are always
            the best things, as they really help me refresh and get ready for the day. Moreover, I can
            spend time on my own to enjoy the beautiful environment of my surroundings.
        </p>
        <p id="p">
            Additionally, working out is another thing that makes me feel good, as I can improve my physical
            strength, and seeing the result of my effort every day makes me feel really good. And, most
            importantly, working out helps me relieve all the work stress of the day.
        </p>
        <p id="p">
            Finally, finishing the day with a light walk after dinner is the best way for me to spend quality
            time with my family and loved ones because not only can I talk with them but also enjoy the beautiful
            night scenery with them too.
